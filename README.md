# WeatherFinder
A web application that finds current weather for cities around the world.

This application has been created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
It uses OpenWeatherMap API (see openweathermap.org) to get the current weather for different cities in the world.
The API provides the weather data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. The data is processed and the weather components 
are displayed to the user.

In the application, the user enters the name of a city in a text box on a web page and upon pushing the submit button, the current weather 
data for the chosen city is displayed in an info window attached to a map displayed on the same web page. The map is a Google map and 
the user has the option of viewing the default styled map or using the controls at the top left corner to switch to satellite view.

To run the application, the files provided here should be downloaded and placed on a server - the main 
file is a PHP file that can only run from a server.
